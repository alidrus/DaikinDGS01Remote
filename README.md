# Daikin/York Air Conditioner Remote Control Protocol

An Arduino IDE library for generating raw IR timings for some Daikin and York
Air Conditioners. These timings can be sent to the Air Conditioner using
IRremote's sendraw() method.

The remote controller protocols are based on the IR signals generated by the
following remote controllers:

- Daikin DGS01
- York ECGS01-i
